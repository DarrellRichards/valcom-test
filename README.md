# Project Idea

Using django we would like to create the ability create a platform called ProjectsToGo. 

# What is ProjectsToGo
We want the ability to GET, CREATE, UPDATE and DELETE projects, to obtain this goal we would be using django, postgres, and python templating with ajax calls.

# Tools Needed:
- Python
- Pipenv
- django
- python templating
- postgres

# Feature Ideas
- GET of all Projects should be listed in a table
- Editting and Creating of the Project should be obtained via a Modal
- Delete should give a warning before deleting


# Model Idea
{
    "name": String, 
    "customer": Int,
    "project_type": [],
    "labels": []
}
